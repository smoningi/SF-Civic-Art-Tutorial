# SF Civic Art Tutorial
Author: Sanat Moningi

The purpose of this document is to provide an introduction on how to use the SF Open Data Portal.

In this tutorial we will use the SODA API to access the SF Civic Art data and visualize it so users can find art in the beautiful city of San Francisco. Please follow the instructions or take a look at the code in the repo to learn how this works.
